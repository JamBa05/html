# Fivem-BasicWebite
Need a basic website for your Fivem Roleplay Server. Clone this repo.

## How to customize
Open the downloaded file and extract it to a folder on your pc.
Open the folder in your prefered code editing program. (I use Visual code)
On the left panel you will see a search icon. Select the icon.
In the search input field type without quotations "YOUR SERVER NAME"
It will find all the places where it found "YOUR SERVER NAME"
Now in the replace bar name it to what ever your server name is.
Great you completed the first step.

To change the link for your discord button
Search for DISCORDCODE in the same search bar. 
Replace it with your own discord code you have from your server.

## Features
